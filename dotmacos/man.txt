${bold}NAME${reset}
    dotmacos - Manage Mac OS and app preferences using config files

${bold}SYNOPSIS${reset}
    dotmacos help
    dotmacos set [--dry-run] [--no-restart-apps] --format FMT file1 ...
    dotmacos get [--dry-run] [--all-keys] --format FMT file1 ...

${bold}DESCRIPTION${reset}
    This utility sets preferences from, and saves them to, structured config
    files. Multiple file formats are supported. The files must have the
    following structure.

        <section>:
          <domain>:
            <key>: <value>

    Valid sections are "user", "local" and "system" corresponding to preferences
    accessed using `defaults read|write`, `defaults -currentHost read|write` and
    `sudo defaults read|write` respectively. To get or set "system" preferences,
    dotmacos must be run as root, e.g. `sudo dotmacos set ...`. Note that to get
    or set "user" and/or "local" preferences, run dotmacos as your regular user.

    Valid domains are those accepted by the `defaults` command. The domains
    currently in use can be listed using `[sudo] defaults [-currentHost]
    domains`.

    Valid keys and values are those used by the OS and/or applications. You can
    list the keys and values currently in use for a given domain using `[sudo]
    defaults [-currentHost] <domain>`. Alternatively, you can use `dotmacos get`
    to get the current keys and values for all domains or for domains of your
    choosing.
